I developed a fully responsive Personal Portfolio Website to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information.


🔧 Tech Stack Used:

 ✨ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with smooth animations & responsive design)

 ✨ Backend: Node.js + Express

 ✨ Database: MongoDB (used for storing contact form submissions)


📌 Key Features:

This project helped me strengthen both my frontend and backend development skills and build a professional platform to present my work.
